Newsletter Setup
Examples of top performing newsletters:
Example: Joe PolishJoe curates his own content in his top card, drives readers to a landing page to attend his event, and curates 3rd party content
Example: Dan MartellDan curates mostly his own content since he has a ton of high engaging evergreen content. His CTA drives users to his Instagram DMs where the reader is pre-qualified for various products.
Note: Our newsletter template is battle tested for rendering, loading speed, and deliverability across multiple devices, browsers, email clients (Gmail, Outlook, etc.) and operating systems.
Not Customizable: We use a single column layout. This is the only layout currently available at this time. Font & Font Size.
Customizable: Content, Copy, Writing Style

Content categories which appear at the top right of each card in the newsletter.

Next Steps & Expectations
